We strongly believe companies should be able to own their own data, and many solutions out there leave organizations to the whims of  third-party providers. Our goal is to reduce the complexity of traditional business intelligence and operations  stacks, while seeking to maximize the efforts of everyday operations staff. This not only simplifies the process for  operators, but also enhances the experience for less infrastructure-aware developers.
